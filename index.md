My name is Alexandra Joseph. I am earning my Master's degree in Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines, where I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2018. I enjoy creating electromechanical devices that automate complex tasks or provide precise control of instruments. With my education in both Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, I am able to take ownership of the entire process: ideation, design, fabrication, and implementing the hardware-software interface.

On this website, you'll find some [projects](./projects) I've worked on independently or was the team lead on.

If you have any questions about my projects, or would like to chat about opportunities, feel free to [email](mailto:acjoseph7@gmail.com) me.
